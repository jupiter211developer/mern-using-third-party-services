# Memorial Backend

## Environment setup

#### Set up mongodb

Local Mongodb is required for development.

Follow instructions on https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/ .

#### Set up environment variables

Place a `.env` file in the project root directory. Contact other developers or copy configuration from heroku.

#### Set up node dependencies

We use node `lts/dubnium` which is `10.16.3` as of Aug, 2019.

[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) might be handy to take control of node versions. Follow instructions on `nvm` readme to install nvm.

And then

```sh
nvm ls-remote # list all node versions on remote
nvm install lts/dubnium # install lts/dubnium
nvm use lts/dubnium
npm i -g yarn
yarn
```

#### DB migration

```sh
yarn run db:migrate # this will run all missing migrations
yarn run db:migrate name-of-migration # this will run specific migration
yarn run db:revert-last # this will revert last migration
```

#### Running the app in Dev mode

```sh
yarn run dev
```

#### Build the app in Prod mode

```sh
yarn start
```

## Deployment

Pushing commits or merging commits to master branch will trigger auto-deploy to heroku.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
